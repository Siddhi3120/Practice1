The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31 March, Eiffel
celebrated by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of 
the press, to the top of the tower.[12] Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the 
ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to 
explain various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few,
including the structural engineer, Émile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean 
Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde 
Illustré, completed the ascent. At 2:35 pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the 
accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level.

There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower 
was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 
May; even then, the lifts had not been completed. The tower was an instant success with 
the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the 
lifts entered service on 26 May.[26] Tickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for 
the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays.
