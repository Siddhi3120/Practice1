Tourism can be  domestic (within the traveller's own country) or  international, and 
international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance 
of payments. 
Tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown (the late-2000s 
recession) between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, and in consequence of 
the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus,but slowly recovered. Globally, 
international tourism receipts (the travel item in balance of payments) grew to US$1.03 
trillion (€740 billion) in 2005, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 
2010.International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists 
globally for the first time in 2012,emerging source markets such as China, Russia, 
and Brazil had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade.The ITB 
Berlin is the world's leading tourism  trade-fair.[better source needed] Global 
tourism accounts for c. 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions.</H2>
