The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel 
of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's her
itage".It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of
India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in 2007, it
was declared a winner of the New7Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.The tomb is
the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble 
structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an 
iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs,
the basic elements are Persian in origin.

The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Persian and earlier Mughal 
architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings 
including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in 
Samarkand),Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht 
(architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), 
and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily
constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with 
semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.
