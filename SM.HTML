Splash Mountain at Tokyo Disneyland is very similar to the Florida version of the ride, 
with a few exceptions. The ride's layout is a mirror image of Florida's owing to the 
attraction's location on the opposite side of the river. The secondary characters are 
altogether different and the show scenes are in different orders. The Tokyo version also 
lacks a mill or barn-like structure on the second lift (although it is used as the main 
entrance to the ride queue). Instead, the logs venture into a cave-like opening to begin
the second ascent. Another difference from the Florida version is that the Slippin' 
Falls drop takes place in a dark cave, making the final drop the only outdoor one.

At the top of this third lift hill, the log descends the 50-foot (15 m) drop at a 
45-degree angle, reaching a maximum speed of 40 mph,[6] into a tunnel underneath the 
Frontierland walkway. After another outdoor flume segment, the log coasts back into the 
mountain, where critters at "Doo Dah Landing" are singing "Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah" in 
celebration of Br'er Rabbit's return, while Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear attempt to fend off
Br'er Gator. At the end, Br'er Rabbit sings with Mr. Bluebird, telling him that he 
learned his lesson.
