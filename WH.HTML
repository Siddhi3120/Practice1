The first U.S. president occupied the Market Street mansion from November 1790 to March 
1797 and altered it in ways that may have influenced the design of the White House. As 
part of a futile effort to have Philadelphia named the permanent national capital, 
Pennsylvania built a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away, but 
Washington declined to occupy it. 
President John Adams also occupied the Market Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. 
On Saturday,November 1, 1800,he became the first president to occupy the White House. 
The President's House in Philadelphia became a hotel and was demolished in 1832, while 
the unused presidential mansion became home to the University of Pennsylvania.

The White House remained accessible in other ways; President Abraham Lincoln complained 
that he was constantly beleaguered by job seekers waiting to ask him for political 
appointments or other favors, or eccentric dispensers of advice like "General" Daniel 
Pratt, as he began the business day. Lincoln put up with the annoyance rather than risk 
alienating some associate or friend of a powerful politician or opinion maker.
