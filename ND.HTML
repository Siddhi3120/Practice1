The cathedral's construction was begun in 1160 under Bishop Maurice de Sully and was 
largely complete by 1260, though it was modified frequently in the following centuries. 
In the 1790s, Notre-Dame suffered desecration during the French Revolution; much of its 
religious imagery was damaged or destroyed. In the 19th century, the cathedral was the 
site of the coronation of Napoleon I and funerals of many Presidents of the Republic.

The cathedral was one of the most widely recognized symbols of the city of Paris and the 
French nation. As the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Paris, Notre-Dame contains the 
cathedra of the Archbishop of Paris (Michel Aupetit). In 1805, Notre-Dame was given the 
honorary status of a minor basilica. Approximately 12 million people visit Notre-Dame 
annually, making it the most visited monument in Paris.[10] The cathedral was renowned 
for its Lent sermons founded by the Dominican Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire in the 
1860s. In recent years, an increasing number have been given by leading public figures 
and state employed academics.
