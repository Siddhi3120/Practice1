The gateway was the site of a terror attack in August 2003, when there was a bomb blast 
in a taxi parked in front of it. Access to the gateway was restricted after people 
congregated at its premises following the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which the Taj 
Hotel opposite the gateway and other locations in its vicinity were targeted. 
In March 2019, the Maharashtra state government proposed a four-step plan to develop the 
location for the convenience of tourists, following a direction issued by the state 
governor in February 2019.The gateway was the location of a terror attack on 25 August 
2003, when there was a bomb blast in front of it.The force of the explosion, from a 
bomb in a taxi parked near the Taj Mahal hotel, reportedly threw bystanders into the sea.
On 13 August 2005, a mentally unstable man stabbed two young girls from Manipur at the 
gateway premises.On New Year's Eve, 2007 a woman was groped by a mob at the gateway.</P>

The gateway's arch has a height of 26 metres (85 feet) with its central dome being 15 
metres (49 feet) in diameter.The monument is built of yellow basalt and 
reinforced concrete.The stones were sourced locally while the perforated screens 
were brought in from Gwalior.The monument faces towards the Mumbai Harbour.
There are four turrets on the structure of the gateway, and there are steps constructed 
behind the arch of the gateway which lead to the Arabian Sea.The monument features 
intricate stone latticework (also known as the jali work).The Scottish architect, 
George Wittet combined elements of the Roman triumphal arch and 16th-century 
architecture of Gujarat.The architecture also combines indigenous architectural 
elements with elements of Islamic architecture, known as the Indo-Saracenic.The harbour 
front was realigned in order to make an esplanade, which would sweep down to the centre 
of the town. On each side of the arch, there are large halls with the capacity to hold 
600 people.The cost of the construction was ?21 lakhs, borne by the then government.
