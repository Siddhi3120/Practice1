Central Park was first approved in 1853 as a 778-acre (3.15 km2) park. In 1857, 
landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and architect/landscape designer Calvert Vaux 
won a design competition to construct the park with a plan they titled the "Greensward 
Plan". Construction began the same year, and the park's first areas were opened to the 
public in late 1858. Additional land at the northern end of Central Park was purchased 
in 1859, and the park was completed in 1876. After a period of decline in the early 20th 
century, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses started a program to clean up 
Central Park. Another decline in the late 20th century spurred the creation of the 
Central Park Conservancy in 1980, which refurbished many parts of the park during the 
1980s and 1990s.

Manhattan; on the west by Central Park West (Eighth Avenue) and the Upper West Side; 
and on the east by Fifth Avenue and the Upper East Side. It measures 2.5 miles (4.0 km)
