The Statue of Liberty is a figure of Libertas, a robed Roman liberty goddess. She holds 
a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata 
inscribed in Roman numerals with "JULY IV MDCCLXXVI" (July 4, 1776), the date of the U.S.
Declaration of Independence. A broken shackle and chain lie at her feet as she walks 
forward, commemorating the recent national abolition of slavery.The statue became an
icon of freedom and of the United States, and a national park tourism destination. It is
a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad. 
Bartholdi was inspired by a French law professor and politician, Édouard René de 
Laboulaye, who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. 
independence would properly be a joint project of the French and U.S. peoples. Because 
of the post-war instability in France.

Any large project was further delayed by the Franco-Prussian War, in which Bartholdi 
served as a major of militia. In the war, Napoleon III was captured and deposed. 
Bartholdi's home province of Alsace was lost to the Prussians, and a more liberal 
republic was installed in France.As Bartholdi had been planning a trip to the United
States, he and Laboulaye decided the time was right to discuss the idea with influential
Americans.In June 1871, Bartholdi crossed the Atlantic, with letters of introduction 
signed by Laboulaye.
