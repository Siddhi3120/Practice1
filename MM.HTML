The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 for the purposes of opening a museum 
to bring art and art education to the American people. It opened on February 20, 1872, 
and was originally located at 681 Fifth Avenue.The permanent collection consists of 
works of art from classical antiquity and ancient Egypt, paintings, and sculptures from 
nearly all the European masters, and an extensive collection of American and modern art.
The Met maintains extensive holdings of African, Asian, Oceanian, Byzantine, and Islamic
art. The museum is home to encyclopedic collections of musical instruments, costumes, 
and accessories, as well as antique weapons and armor from around the world.

The collection ranges from 40,000-year-old indigenous Australian rock paintings, to a 
group of 15-foot-tall (4.6 m) memorial poles carved by the Asmat people of New Guinea, 
to a priceless collection of ceremonial and personal objects from the Nigerian Court of 
Benin donated by Klaus Perls.The range of materials represented in the Africa, 
Oceania, and Americas collection is undoubtedly the widest of any department at the Met, 
including everything from precious metals to porcupine quills.
