Mughal architecture greatly influenced the architectural style of several buildings of 
the fort.Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent 
palace is laid out on four levels, each with a courtyard. It consists of the Diwan-e-Aam,
or "Hall of Public Audience", the Diwan-e-Khas, or "Hall of Private Audience", the 
Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), or Jai Mandir, and the Sukh Niwas where a cool climate is 
artificially created by winds that blow over a water cascade within the palace. Hence, 
the Amer Fort is also popularly known as the Amer Palace.The palace was the 
residence of the Rajput Maharajas and their families. At the entrance to the palace near 
the fort's Ganesh Gate, there is a temple dedicated to Shila Devi, a goddess of the 
Chaitanya cult, which was given to Raja Man Singh when he defeated the Raja of Jessore, 
Bengal in 1604. (Jessore is now in Bangladesh).

Amer was known in the medieval period as Dhundar (meaning attributed to a sacrificial 
mount in the western frontiers) and ruled by the Kachwahas from the 11th century onwards 
– between 1037 and 1727 AD, till the capital was moved from Amer to Jaipur.The 
history of Amer is indelibly linked to these rulers as they founded their empire at Amer. 
Many of the ancient structures of the medieval period of the Meenas have been either 
destroyed or replaced. However, the 16th-century impressive edifice of the Amer Fort and 
the palace complex within it built by the Rajput Maharajas are very well preserved.
