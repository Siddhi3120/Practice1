The idea for the Mansion precedes Disneyland and WED Enterprises, to when Walt Disney 
hired the first of his Imagineers.At the time, the park they were developing the 
attraction for was supposed to be located across from the studios. In 1951, the first 
known illustration of the park showed a main street setting, green fields, western 
village and a carnival.Disney Legend Harper Goff developed a black-and-white sketch 
of a crooked street leading away from main street by a peaceful church and graveyard, 
with a run-down manor perched high on a hill that towered over main street.

Disney assigned Imagineer Ken Anderson to create a story using Goff's idea.Plans were 
made to build a New Orleans-themed land in the small transition area between 
Frontierland and Adventureland. Weeks later, New Orleans Square appeared on the souvenir 
map and promised a thieves market, a pirate wax museum, and a haunted house walk-through.
Anderson studied New Orleans and old plantations and came up with a drawing of an 
antebellum manor overgrown with weeds, dead trees, swarms of bats and boarded doors and 
windows topped by a screeching cat as a weather vane.
