Niagara Falls is famed both for its beauty and as a valuable source of hydroelectric 
power. Balancing recreational, commercial, and industrial uses has been a challenge for 
the stewards of the falls since the 19th century.The features that became Niagara Falls 
were created by the Wisconsin glaciation about 10,000 years ago. The same forces also 
created the North American Great Lakes and the Niagara River. All were dug by a 
continental ice sheet that drove through the area, deepening some river channels to form 
lakes, and damming others with debris.Scientists argue there is an old valley, St 
David's Buried Gorge, buried by glacial drift, at the approximate location.

The Niagara Falls Power Company, a descendant of Schoellkopf's firm, formed the Cataract 
Company headed by Edward Dean Adams,with the intent of expanding Niagara Falls' 
power capacity. In 1890, a five-member International Niagara Commission headed by Sir 
William Thomson among other distinguished scientists deliberated on the expansion of 
Niagara hydroelectric capacity based on seventeen proposals, but could not select any as 
the best combined project for hydraulic development and distribution. In 1893, 
Westinghouse Electric (which had built the smaller-scale Ames Hydroelectric Generating 
Plant near Ophir, Colorado, two years earlier) was hired to design a system to generate 
alternating current on Niagara Falls, and three years after that this large-scale AC 
power system was created (activated on August 26, 1895).The Adams Power Plant 
Transformer House remains as a landmark of the original system.
